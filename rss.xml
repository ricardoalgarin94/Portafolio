<article> <section class="page"> <p>The close of the fiscal year at the state university system where pilot fish works has been a nightmare, with one narrowly averted catastrophe after another.</p><p>First, one of the buyers in Purchasing has trouble processing requisitions into purchase orders, and the busiest time of the year for his department coming with the start of the new fiscal year. It looks like an easy problem to solve — but it isn’t, and eventually nearly the entire IT staff is working on it, the software vendor is contacted, and no solution is in sight. The only good news is that the fiscal year will close on Friday this year, so they’ll have the entire weekend to work on this problem before those requisitions have to be processed on Monday.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3408912/should-auld-acquaintance.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<article> <section class="page"> <p>I watched with interest this week <a href="https://fortune.com/2019/07/16/intel-ceo-bob-swan/" rel="nofollow">an interview with Bob Swan, Intel’s latest CEO by Fortune's Aaron Pressman</a>. Pressman did a reasonable job getting Swan to answer difficult questions and Swan was quickly able to move from being CFO and acting CEO to full CEO. This isn’t such a bad way to get the job because the Intel board was able to see how Swan actually performed in the job before officially giving him the role.</p><p>I typically prefer subject matter experts in CEO roles because they tend to perform better, but a CFO <em>does</em> generally know where the bodies are buried and from day one can generally determine where his effort, and the company’s money, needs to be spent.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3410041/intels-turnaround-is-showing-strong-potential.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<article> <section class="page"> <p>This company has been growing for the past couple of decades by acquiring smaller companies that do similar things. In the process, it acquires a lot of solutions these companies had developed, as well as the solutions’ accompanying code. Of course, the acquiring company has been less keen on retaining all the engineers who wrote that code, and year by year, their numbers decrease, until the company finds itself with a whole lot of code that no one really knows and a bunch of young employees.</p><p>It needs to hire someone to help. It has no problem getting young and smart candidates to interview, but they all lose interest when told that none of the code they are going to have to deploy and maintain is in their preferred languages, it has nothing to do with AI, and none of it is in the cloud.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3409061/help-wanted.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

Even before the <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3393971/review-windows-10-may-2019-update-version-1903-unleashes-a-spring-surprise.html">Windows 10 May 2019 Update</a> (version 1903) started to roll out, the company began working on upcoming feature updates to Windows 10. As it did with version 1903, Microsoft has been releasing a series of public preview builds to members of <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3014600/microsoft-windows/how-to-handle-windows-10-updates.html?page=2#toc-4">Microsoft's Windows Insider Program</a>.</p><p>After years of using “Redstone” in its code names, Microsoft switched to a new format with the May 2019 Update. The new code names use a <em>YYH1</em>/<em>YYH2</em> format, with the <em>YY</em> standing for the last two numbers of the year and <em>H1</em> or <em>H2</em> referring to the first or second half of the year. So Windows 10 version 1903, which was released in May 2019, was code-named “19H1” (for first half of 2019) rather than “Redstone 6.” The next feature update, due in the fall of this year, is code-named “19H2,” and the feature update that’s coming in the spring of 2020 is code-named 20H1.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3118132/windows-10-redstone-a-guide-to-the-insider-preview-builds.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>

<article> <section class="page"> <p>Smartphone makers have looked to the emerging markets, particularly China, for growth over the past couple of years — especially in the all important high-end market where margins are made. But the Chinese market for high-performance smartphones is becoming saturated, as is much of the rest of the developed world. Many people now balk at spending $1,000-plus each year for a new device that has only relatively modest improvements in features/functions. Indeed, this is a similar problem that the PC space has had for several years</p><p>What’s needed is a new growth path for high-end devices. And much like the PC space, phone makers appear to have found one – in gaming. Phone makers are looking to relatively gaming-friendly markets like China and the Far East as the first area to concentrate on but with a bigger vision for other mature markets like North America and Europe.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3409778/how-gaming-can-save-high-end-smartphones.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>
